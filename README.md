        I'm Lucas, a <strong>Cloud DevSecOps <em>Evangelist</em></strong> and <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>. I love <b>puzzles</b>, <b>patterns</b>, <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_theory_of_mind#Semantics_of_mental_states:~:text=computational%20theory%20of%20mind%20states,of%20the%20language%20of%20thought."><dfn>semantic structures</dfn></a></b> and <b>adding "by-design" and "as-code" suffixes</b> to everything.

  </p>
  <p>
    <sup>&#x1F4E8;</sup> Well, that covers a lot, so <em>let me clear up some questions</em> you might be inclined to ask<b>: </b><sup>&#128172;</sup>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <blockquote><em>What is your <strong>stack</strong>&#10068; In what <strong>language</strong> do you code&#10068;</em></blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The most proper and honest answer to is: "<em>that's not up to me!</em>"</li>
    <li>It is the project that defines the stack and, needless to say, the language. <br>
      Contradicting is <q>like using a hammer to put on your shoes</q> - is contradicting reason itself.</li>
    <li><strong>The context defines the stack, not otherwise</strong> - our goal is to choose the right tool for the job.</li>
    <li>With that being said, by "full stack" I mean that I am an <strong>"end-to-end" developer</strong>, <strong>language-agnostic</strong></li>
    <li>For a technology to arise, it has both to start and to end - it has to be released into the wild.<br>
      The only way to accomplish this by <strong>relentlessly pursuing curiosity</strong>, through a endless journey of <em>continuous learning</em> and evolvement.</li>
    <li>Plainly put: <em>I develop using the most appropriate tools for the given project</em>, <strong>learning them on demand</strong>. More than often, also <em>relearning</em> them on demand.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <blockquote><em>Ok, what about the <strong>Cloud DevSecOps</strong>? Is that even a job? Is this even a word&#10068;</em></blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Until someone comes up with a better name, it is a job, because someone has to do it.</li>
    <li>From ideation to production, the <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> lifecycle is composed by a myriad of small pieces and events that, once pulled together, exists as a true living organism. For lack of a better term, I call "<strong><dfn>DevSecOps Evangelist</dfn></strong>" the one who <em>orchestrates</em> these processes and build a whole culture around them - the one who "spread the word".<br>
      My work is to <strong>orchestrate how the development will play out</strong>, making sure that the engines are in sync, while also placing myself on the remaining empty seats. Speaking of which, here is where I play my role as a full-stack developer.</li>
    <li>And, yes, there is <strong>a "<dfn title="Information Security">Sec</dfn>" in between</strong>. Rather than a tendency, <strong><dfn title="moving security sooner in the development process">shifting left on security</dfn></strong> is already a <em>vital part</em> within the technology industry.</li>
    <li>An <dfn title="conducive to effective and adaptive teamwork, rooted in healthy culture and communication">Agile Environment</dfn> by itself is <em>no longer enough</em> to achieve excellency. To take full advantage of the agility and responsiveness it provides, the <em>development, security and operations</em> teams must march together throughout the entire <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> lifecycle. <em>Nowadays</em>, this means <strong>fully integrating <abbr title="Information Security">InfoSec</abbr></strong> into the processes and, furthermore, <strong>establishing <abbr title="Operations Security">OpSec</abbr> best-practices</strong> among everyone's playbook.</li>
    <li>Lastly, regarding <strong>the "<dfn title="Cloud Computing">Cloud</dfn>"</strong> part, well, <em>those who stay grounded soon shall be carried away be the wave</em>.</li>
    <li>Nonetheless, I'll list below some tools-of-choice I'm currently using or have used along the way, after all, for you to find me, I still have to spread some keywords around here.</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote><em>No way! How do you even find the time to learn all these stuff, apply them and still keep up to date&#10068;</em></blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Again, one must must be relentlessly curious.</li>
    <li>However, there is indeed a trick to effectively get all these things done:<br>
       I enjoy coding, but just once. By wrapping my code around functional modules and leveraging on meta-programming, I spend less time with things I've already done and invest that time on learning.</li>
    <li>Inevitably it comes to a point where most of the coding is actually refactoring. This is the sweet spot, inasmuch as each code refactoring emerges from discovering a better way to reach the same result.</li>
    <li>Summing up: learning > refactoring > coding/implementing.</li>
  </ul>

      #### Programming Languages
      By and large, on a daily basis I use multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming languages interchangeably.
      More specific:
      Long story with R, she was my first. I still catch myself amazed by Tidyverse's coding standards.
      Falling in love with Rust, heavily biased when I say that it she will conquer us all.
      Bash scripting for command line and crafting general utilities.
      Python for building stuff, especially in the cloud.
      JavaScript and typescript to break stuff.

      #### Workspaces
      ##### OS


      How do you
