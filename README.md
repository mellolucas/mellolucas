## 🧑‍💻 whoami

Hey there! I'm **Lucas Mello**, a Platform Engineer, Full-Cycle Problem Solver, and dedicated **Philomath**—forever curious, always diving head-first into puzzles, patterns, and turning complex challenges into seamless solutions.

I'm currently driving a large-scale **Platform Engineering** transformation at **Banco Bradesco**, orchestrating the strategic adoption of **GitHub Enterprise**. We've successfully onboarded **4,000+ developers** using automated **GitHub Actions** pipelines, significantly boosted productivity, and seamlessly migrated legacy systems—earning global recognition from GitHub and Microsoft leadership (including an upcoming Microsoft Developer Blog feature!).

I firmly believe great software emerges from thoughtful **Systems Design**, effective **Solution Architecture**, clear **Technical Documentation**, and continuous collaboration across teams.
